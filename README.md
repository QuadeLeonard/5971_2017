1.      Master: Stable Version \Production Top and main branch.   
Nobody should be pushing to this branch but one person to avoid messing up the production code.     

Only staging branch will have rights to push to it. In case of hot-fix on a development branch with fix can be merged and pushed to it. (Only by the executives and Senior Developers)

2.      Staging Branch: Beta Testing, Testing environment.     
Only development branch (Alpha testing branch) should be pushing to this branch.

It gets code updates from development branch.

3. Development Branch (Usually called integration in the four tier architecture) (alpha testing branch)
 It gets codes from individual developerâ€™s branch.  It is the branch for hot-fixes.(Happens once we complete a cycle and have another development branch as current version of application)  Branch is unstable (Can break as developers are constantly merging to it.)     

 
4.Individual Branches (Usually called development in the four tier architecture)
Each developer works on their individual branch.
